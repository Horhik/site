I saw [[https://github.com/Horhik/ProgrammingChallenges-v4.0/blob/main/PCv4.png?raw=true][this]] image about a +year ago+... OMG, it was 2020! So, about a 3 years ago :)

Since that I had that idea in my mind, but only now I feel myself ready to that, or maybe I just want to code and get some new skills, expand my horizons üßê

So, I decided to start this jorney and for that I'll post poll on the [[https://mastodon.ml/@horhik][fediverse]] for each new challenge, where you, my reader, will be able to select which way I'll suffer next time.

Poll will contain challenge and language to code on /(e.g. =haskell=, =lisp=, =C=, =Rust=, =NASM=, *maybe smth else*)/
**  Why am I doing that ü•≤
I lost myself a bit... So, I want to code, I want to explore new things, I want to find a sphere üåê I interested in... My knowledges for now are so abstract /(except fronted-development, but I don't want it)/, and doing this challenges, I guess, will make me more aware about different sides this *N*-dimentional shape of applied programming 
** Tracking the progres
